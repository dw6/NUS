How are organisms named and classified?

a) Taxonomy:
The science of naming and classifying organisms 

b) Systematics:
The science by which biologists organize and classifying organisms focusing on reconstructing Phylogeny [evolutionary history].

Organisms in each species can potentially interbreed under natural conditions

What are the major Taxonomic Ranks? aka Linnaean classification system
 
1. Domain  [e.g. Eukarya]
2. Kingdom [e.g. Animalia]
3. Phylum (plural: phyla) [e.g. Chordata]
4. Class [e.g. Mammalia]
5. Order [e.g. Primates]
6. Family [Hominidae]
7. Genus (plural: genera) [Homo, Caps, Italics] 
8. Species (plural: species) [sapiens, lowercased, italics]

What is a Subspecies?

A group of organisms inhabits a geographical area or type of habitat different from other members of the same species.

• sp.   = species in the singular
• spp.  = species in the plural
• ssp.  = subspecies in the singular 
• sspp. = subspecies in the plural

When do Hybrids occur?

Hybrids result from crossbreeding between two species or genera

Examples of scientific names:
[Note that all should be italized.]

Invented by Carolus Linnaeus [Swedish, 1707–1778]

LHS = Generic Name
RHS = Specific epithet

• Broccoli: Brassica oleracea var. italica
• Carnation: Dianthus caryophyllus
• Coffee: Coffea arabica
• Coconut: Cocos nucifera
• Rice: Oryza sativa
• Rose: Rosa sp
• Sweet potato: Ipomoea batatas
• Chicken: Gallus gallus

What are the components of a full scientific name?

Generic name + Specific Epithet + Author(s)
e.g.: Homo sapiens L. [Note that L. is not in italics]
e.g.: Nepenthes rafflesiana Jack

What is the main aim of Modern Classification?

- Strongly influenced by evolutionary theory
- To reconstruct the tree of life or phylogeny (evolutionary history)
- Use anatomy -> Key role in systematics
- developmental characteristics
- molecular similarities
  - chromosomes. banding patterns reveal degree of similarities.


What are the domains of life?

Biodiversity = Total range of species diversity
• Before 1970: organisms divided into 2 kingdoms
o Kingdom Animalia (animals) 
o Kingdom Plantae (plants)

1969: Robert H. Whittaker’s 5-kingdom
system was proposed
o Kingdom Animalia 	(animals) 
o Kingdom Plantae 	(plants)
o Kingdom Fungi 		(fungi)
o Kingdom Monera 		(bacteria) 
o Kingdom Protista 	(protists)

1970: Carl Woese’s 3-domain system 
-> Molecular biology analysis e.g. RNA

Bacteria
 - Prokaryotic
 - Unicellular
 - Cell wall has Peptidoglycan
Archaea
 - Prokaryotic
 - Unicelluar
 - Cell wall *lacks* Peptidoglycan

Eukarya
 - animals
 - fungi
 - plants
 - protists
		-> Eukaryotic
		-> Uni and Multicellular
		
[ See Table 18-2, Slide 38 on Characteristics of Eukaryotic Kingdoms]

What are Protists?

Plant-like protists (algae)
• Fungus-like protists (water and slime molds)
• Animal-like protists (protozoa)

What are Fungi?
• Fungal mycelium with many hyphae
• Mushroom is the reproductive structure of some fungi

What are Plantae?
• Bryophytes 		(non-vascular plants): Mosses and liverworts
• Pteridophytes (vascular plants, non-flowering, no seeds): Ferns
• Gymnosperms 	(vascular non- flowering, seeds): conifers, gingko, cycad
• Angiosperms 	(vascular, flowering, seeds)

What are Animalia?
Animalia
• Invertebrates (without backbones): Jelly fishes, worms, insects, spiders, snails, sea stars
• Vertebrates (with backbones): Fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals

What's the difference between a species and a hybrid ?

5. How many species exist? • Actually scientists do not know!
• Current status
	o 1.5 million described so far
	o 7–10 thousand new species discovered per year (mostly insects)
	o Breakdown of species identified:
		5% prokaryotes and protists  
		22% plants and fungi
		73% animals
	
• Estimates of total species number on Earth 
	o 7 to 10 million
	o Up to 100 million
	o 5 million to 30 million
	
	
What is Biodiversity?

- It is the total range of species diversity
- The richness of number and individuals of different species in an environment.
