[1. Introduction]

- Key theory which explains how the diversity of life arose
- It is the most important and controversial biological theory
- explain phenomena such as how resistance to pesticides or antibiotics arises

What is Evolution?

1. try to explain how modern day life forms were modified from previous life forms
2. The descent of modern organisms with modification from pre‐existing life‐forms, i.e., “descent with modification”

[2. How did evolutionary thought develop?]

Asking "Why there is such diversity of life?"

• Evolutionary thought heavily influenced by religion
• Creationism
	Each species was created individually.
		– All organisms were created simultaneously
		– Each distinct life‐form was permanently fixed and did not change over time
		– Implied that each species is fixed and immutable

But ..

Fossil discoveries made in 1700s were the driven force for formulating the early evolutionary ideas

Fossils of lower (older) rocks show progressive transition to more modern forms in upper rocks
		
[3. How does natural selection work?]

Darwin and Wallace proposed that life’s huge diversity of life forms observed arose by a process of descent with modification

• Individuals in each generation differ slightly from previous generation
• Over long stretch of time, such small differences accumulated to become major transformation
• The theory rests on 4 postulates about populations

(1). Individuals in a population vary

Individual members of a population are not identical, but differ from one another in many respects.

In their ability to obtain food, to withstand environmental stresses, to escape predators etc.

The variations arise purely by chance 
Individuals are produced sexually

(2) Traits are passed from parents to offspring

Some of these characteristics are genetic differences and can pass to next generation.
Note: the principles of genetics had not yet been discovered during Darwin’s time (about 1859)

Note: No theory of inheritance (genetics) developed yet as Gregor Mendel (1822–1882) did not publish his work till 1865 (but not noticed till 1900)!

By inheritance those individuals better fit will pass their characteristics on to the next and future generations in greater numbers than those less fit.

(3) Some individuals fail to survive and reproduce

• Organisms produce far more offspring than are required to replace the parents
• However, the number of individuals in natural populations tends to remain relatively constant.
• Some individuals fail to survive and reproduce
• Individuals have to compete to survive


(4) Survival and reproduction are not determined by chance

• Reproductive success is not random, it depends on an individual’s characteristics.
• Winners are not determined by chance but by the traits they possess.
• The following generations of individuals will exhibit, and continue to improve, the adaptations realized in gradual changes by their ancestors.
• Natural selection modifies populations over time

[4. Evidence for Evolution]

What evidence in present to support the theory of evolution?

• Fossils
• Comparative anatomy
• Similarity in embryology
• Similarity in biochemistry and molecular biology

[Fossils]
• Fossils of ancient species tend to be simpler than modern species
• Graded sequences of changes in form

[Comparative Anatomy]

a) Analogous structures

[Unrelated species] in [similar environments] have evolved analogous structures by convergent evolution

Analogous structures = Structures with similar functions and superficially similar appearance but have different anatomies

[Wing structure b/w insect and bird, Penguin and Sea Lion]

b) Homologous structures

[Related species] in [different environments] have homologous structures
Homologous structures = Structures that may differ in function but have similar anatomy
Homologous structures provide evidence of common ancestry

Homologous structures are similar anatomically. Same set of bones, modified for flying, running, swimming etc because evolved from same ancestral structure

c) Vestigial structures

Structures that serve no apparent purpose
These functionless structures are inherited from ancestors
Evolutionary theory suggests that as the animals evolved into new habitats, some of their structures that made them less fit were reduced to the point of insignificance

e.g.: Salamander, Baleen whale, Boa constrictor

[Embryological similarity]

Similarity in the stages of embryological development in very different types of vertebrates, e.g., gill slits and tail


[Similarities in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology]

• DNA, RNA, ribosomes, same 20 amino acids, ATP as energy carrier in [all] organisms
• Similarities in chromosome structure, sequences of amino acids in proteins
