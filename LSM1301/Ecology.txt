1. Introduction

What is Ecology? 

It is study on inter-relationships of organisms with each other and their non-living environment

Interactions with

• Biotic environment 
• Abiotic (Physical rather than biological) environment

What is the Ecosystem?

The community (biotic/living component) and its non-living environment (abiotic component) within a defined area

Ecosystem = Community (Biotic) + Abiotic environment

2. Community interactions

Community = [biotic component of ecosystem]
All the interacting populations within an ecosystem

[ Levels of Organization ]
Ecosystem  | A community together with its non-living surroundings
Community  | 2 >= populations of different species living and interacting in the same area
Population | Members of one species inhabiting the same area
Species    | Very similar, potentially interbreeding organisms

What are community interactions important?

The influence:
• Each other’s ability to survive and reproduce
• Population size
• Populations act on one another as agents of natural selection
