To execute the exploit, simply run either

	(a) "./run"

	Executes the script for task 1. This turns off the stack protector and turns off ASLR. It 
	incrementally tries each offset (exploit.c accepts a single argument, the offset), and on
	a successful attempt, a root shell is returned.


	(b) "./run2" 

	Executes the script for task 2. This turns ASLR on and searches for a suitable return address
	This process takes quite a while, but a successful exploit usually takes around 4000 to 5000
	attempts.
